# One dimensional tight-binding chain
In this basic tutorial we will address how to compute the band structure of a one dimensional tight binding model.

The Hamiltonian of a one dimensional tight binding chain takes the form

$$H = \sum_n c^\dagger_n c_{n+1} + h.c.$$

This model can be diagonalized analytitically, giving rise to a diagonal Hamiltonian of the form

$$
H = \sum_k \epsilon_k \Psi^\dagger_k \Psi_k
$$

where energy momentum dispersion takes the form

$$
\epsilon_k = 2\cos{k}
$$
