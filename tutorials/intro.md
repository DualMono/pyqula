# One dimensional tight-binding chain
In this basic tutorial we will address how to compute the band structure of a one dimensional tight binding model.

The Hamiltonian of a one dimensional tight binding chain takes the form

$$H = \sum_n c^\dagger_n c_{n+1} + h.c.$$

This model can be diagonalized analytically, giving rise to a diagonal Hamiltonian of the form

$$
H = \sum_k \epsilon_k \Psi^\dagger_k \Psi_k
$$

where energy momentum dispersion takes the form

$$
\epsilon_k = 2\cos{k}
$$

With the pyqula library, the previous band structure can be computed as

```python
from pyqula import geometry
g = geometry.chain() # geometry of the 1D chain
h = g.get_hamiltonian() # generate the Hamiltonian
(k,e) = h.get_bands() # compute band structure
```

## Including second and third neighbor hopping

By default, the Hamiltonian generated includes only first neighbor hopping
$t_1=1$. However, we may want to consider a generalized Hamiltonian of the form

$$
H = 
\sum_n c^\dagger_n c_{n+1} +
t_2\sum_n c^\dagger_n c_{n+2} +
t_3\sum_n c^\dagger_n c_{n+3} +
h.c.
$$

To compute the eigenvalues in this generalized model
taking $t_2 =0.2$ and $t_3=0.3$, we write

```python
from pyqula import geometry
g = geometry.chain() # geometry of the 1D chain
h = g.get_hamiltonian() # generate the Hamiltonian
(k,e) = h.get_bands(tij=[1.0,0.2,0.3]) # compute band structure
```


## Including an external Zeeman field

In the following we will consider that we want to add an external Zeeman field to the electronic system. We now include the existence of a spin degree of freedom, considering the Hamiltonian

$$
H = H_0 +H_Z
$$

where $H_0$ is the original tight binding Hamiltonian

$$
H_0 = \sum_{n,s} c^\dagger_{n,s} c_{n+1,s} + h.c.
$$

and

$$
H_Z = \sum_{n,s,s'} \vec B \cdot \vec \sigma^{s,s'} c^\dagger_{n,s} c_{n,s'}
$$

with $n$ running over the sites and $s,s'$ running over the spin degree of freedom. The magnetic field takes the form $\vec B = (B_x,B_y,B_z)$, and
$\sigma_\alpha$ are the spin Pauli matrices. To add a magnetic field
of the form $\vec B = (0.1,0.2,0.3)$ to our chain we write

```python
from pyqula import geometry
g = geometry.chain() # geometry of the 1D chain
h = g.get_hamiltonian() # generate the Hamiltonian
h = g.add_zeeman([0.1,0.2,0.3]) # add the Zeeman field
(k,e) = h.get_bands() # compute band structure
```


# Two dimensional band structures
In the following we move on to consider a two dimensional mutliorbital model, in particular a honeycomb lattice. The Hamiltonian takes the form


$$H = \sum_{\langle ij\rangle} c^\dagger_i c_{j} + h.c.$$

where $\langle ij\rangle$ denotes first neighbors of the honeycomb lattice. This model can be diagonalized analytically, giving rise to a diagonal Hamiltonian of the form

$$
H = \sum_{k,\alpha} \epsilon_{k,\alpha} \Psi^\dagger_{k,\alpha} \Psi_{k,\alpha}
$$

where $\alpha$ is the band index.

The previous calculation can be performed as

```python
from pyqula import geometry
g = geometry.honeycomb_lattice() # geometry of the 2D model
h = g.get_hamiltonian() # generate the Hamiltonian
(k,e) = h.get_bands() # compute band structure
```
